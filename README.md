## How to Run:
  1. Clone the repository
  2. Open the projec in Visual Studio

## How To Use:

### Chats / Messaging:
	1. Chat rooms are displayed in the left navigation bar, click any chat to view it
	2. The members of the chat room you are in are displayed on the right side users bar
	2. Once in a chat you can type a message in the bottom textarea and hit enter to send the message
	3. Once a message is sent you can click the 'x' button in the top right corner of the message box to delete it
	   (professors can also delete the messages of any user)
	4. Messages from other users will automatically appear in a chat once they are sent (to simulate this you can open another tab with
		the website and send a message while logged in an another user.)

### Creating Chat Rooms:

	1. As a student you can click 'settings' and then 'Request One-on-One' to create a chat with you and the professor
	2. As a professor you can click 'settings' and then 'Add Chat Room' or 'Add Forum Chat' to create a new chat room
	3. After clicking either button simply fill in the necessary info and hit confirm

### Editing Chat Room Users:
	
	*Note* Users cannot be added or removed from the open-chat (default chat room)
	1. As a professor click 'settings' and then 'Edit Chat Room Users'
	2. On the next menu that comes up users that are checked off are currently in the room
	3. You can un-check or check users to remove or add them to the chat room
	4. Once you are done simply click 'confirm' to make your changes

### Muting and Unmuting users:

	1. As a professor click 'settings'
	2. Next you can either click 'Mute/Unmute Users Globally' or 'Mute/Unmute Users in Current Channel' (Global muting mutes a user across all chats)
	3. In the next menu simply click/check off users you wish to mute
	4. If users are already muted they will be checked off when you open the menu, you can click this again to un-check them which will unmute them
	5. When you are done hit 'Confirm' to apply your changes

### Viewing the Log:
	
	The website logs actions such as creating and deleting chat rooms, deleting messages, and muting and unmuting users
	1. As a professor click 'settings'
	2. Next click 'Open Log'
	3. You are now in the log and can view all logged actions
	4. To exit the log you can either click 'close' at the bottom of the pop-up or the 'x' button at the top of it
